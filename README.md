# Python-Security-Camera
The code for building an OpenCV Python security camera.

# Install OpenCV
Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install the OpenCV library:

**pip install opencv-python**

If you also need OpenCV's additional functionalities like cv2.VideoWriter, install the full package:

**pip install opencv-contrib-python**

#  Verify Installation
After installation, verify by running the following in your Python environment:

**import cv2
print(cv2.__version__)**

If this works without any error, the module is installed correctly.

# Common Installation Issues
Pip version issues: Make sure your pip is up to date:

**python -m pip install --upgrade pip**

Virtual environment conflicts: Ensure you are using the correct Python environment where OpenCV is installed.
